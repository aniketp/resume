\descript{| Since May'17}
\location{Summer Project , Programming Club}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
  \item Worked on a scalable web application with a diverse technology stack.
  \item Used Scala with Akka and Couchbase among other technologies for
    developing the backend.
  \item	Implemented Notifications, XSRF \& XSSI Protection and a method
    to batch process api requests as part of the backend api. \\

\vspace{0.2 cm}
\runsubsection{Computational Complexity Theory}
\descript{| $2^{nd}$ Semester }
\location{ACA Semester Project}
\begin{tightemize}
  \item Reading Project on Theory of Computation. Studied about non-deterministic complexity classes eg. NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard.
  \item Researched the fundamental working of \textbf{Turing Machine} and its properties. Analyzed famous NP-Complete problems, e.g SAT, Hamiltonian Path, Travelling Salesman etc. 
  \item Understood the implication of Complexity Theory in Quantum Computing and Cryptography.
  \item Prepared the final report in \LaTeX{} which is now under examination. //
