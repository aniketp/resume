\descript{| Apr'18 - Present}
\location{The FreeBSD Project | Mentor: Dr. Robert N. M. Watson}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
  \item Built a self-contained Regression Test-Suite for FreeBSD's Audit Subsystem. 
  \item Contributed more than \textbf{500} test-cases for \textbf{165} OpenBSM auditable system calls.
  \item Developed an automation infrastructure using libbsm(3) APIs within the kernel which does a synchronous polling on /dev/auditpipe to extract out the BSM tokens.
  \item	Was able to complete the entire project in less than 1/3rd of total duration. Major part of the Test-Suite already merged in the 12-CURRENT branch. (\href{https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/tests/sys/audit}{LINK})
